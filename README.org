A list of blog posts, videos, exercises on various tech topics that I find useful.

** Productivity
*** Org mode
 * [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTwQvgfgMM][Emacs Org-mode - a system for note-taking and project planning - Carsten Dominik]]
   An introduction to emacs org mode by the creator Carsten Dominik
   himself. This was a part of the google tech talks 2008. This is a
   very simple but comprehensive talk on why org mode exists and how to
   use it.
 * [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzA2YODtgK4][Getting Started With Org Mode]] - [[https://harryrschwartz.com/][Harry Schwartz]]
   This is a getting started guide on what org mode is and some of the
   crazy stuff you can get done using org mode on emacs.

 * [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAT6OZ9Xel4][A scalable, versioned document store in PostgreSQL]]
   This is talk at the 2018 PostgresOpen which talks about how Udacity
   maintains their whole curriculum in a postgres database while allowing
   for versioning of changes in their tree like data model. It's a very
   informative talk, if not for postgres but how they modeled a git like
   semantics in postgres
 * [[https://www.youtube.com/user/postgresopen][ANSI, Schmansi!]]
   The not so ANSI SQL features that postgres provides that makes it a better
   whole round database and that might nudge you into using postgres or even
   using postgres in a better way. This is just an overall walk through of
   such features. Quite a bit that I personally wasn't aware of.
 * [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhOkob2PQFQ][Identifying Slow Queries and Fixing Them!]]
   This talk revolves around methods of identifying slow queries like logs,
   tools and in build postgres shared libs. Then it focuses on the reasons
   why there could be slow queries in the first place. And lastly on to what
   are the ways these could be avoided. This is not a very specific use case
   fix my all problem guide but an overall where all to look guide.
